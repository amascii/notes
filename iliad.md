## BOOK ONE - The Rage of Achilles
Agamemnon pisses of a priest for not returning his daughter and the Achaeans get punished for it. To save his army he must return the girl, but he's a crybaby and insists on somebody's prize girl. He specifically wants Achilles' (guy with anger issues) girl. They both feel wronged, as if something that belongs to them was being forcefully taken (I know, right?). Anyway, Achilles is devastated and begs his mommy, Thetis, for help, who asks Zeus to do something about it. He agrees.

## BOOK TWO - The Great Gathering of Armies
Zeus sends Agamemnon a dream, inciting him to war. Agamemnon tests his men before going into battle by saying they should just give up. The rank and file gladly makes for home, only to be stopped by their commanders. They are motivated by Odysseus'/Nestor's war speech. Armies from both sides gather (except Achilles & friends).
